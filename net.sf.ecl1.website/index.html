<h1>Ecl1: Eclipse Toolset for HISinOne Extensions</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
	
	<p>Ecl1 is an Eclipse toolset that supports the development of <a href="http://www.hisinone.de">HISinOne</a> extensions.
   		The current released version of the ecl1 toolset is 1.7.0.2022-11-30. </p>
   		
   	<p> Release notes can be found <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ecl1/files/">here</a></p>	
	
	<ul>
		<li>Wizard for new extension projects, that creates an empty project fitting to the required structure</li>
		<li>Import Wizard for existing extension projects</li>
		<li>Wizard to provide individual checkers for the enrollment process</li>
		<li>Visualization of extension points in all projects</li>
		<li>Automated support for projects contributing to an extension point in HISinOne</li>
		<li>Extended Classpath support for embedding infrastructure extensions</li>
		<li>Export wizard to create HIS specific hotfix XML snippets</li>
		<li>Update Check for ecl1 on startup</li>
		<li>And more!</li>
	</ul>


<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

	<p> You can install the current version of the Ecl1 via our <a href="http://ecl1.sourceforge.net/update/">update site</a>. </p>
	   
	   <p>To use the Ecl1 toolset you need Eclipse Neon (2016-06) or later and Java 8 or above. It runs both on Windows and Linux systems.</p>
	   <p><em>Note that since January 2017, Eclipse must be run with a JDK8 >= 8u101 having strong encryption to be able to update from Sourceforge sites. </em></p>

	<p>After you have installed Ecl1, you should have a new category "HISinOne" for new projects, if you try to create a new project for example via pressing Ctrl + N</p>

	<p>As an alternative option, you can download the latest plugin version via <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ecl1/files/latest/download?source=files">sourceforge</a> as an update site archive.</p>


<h2 id="auto_start_plugins">Auto Start Plugins</h2>
	
	<p>
		Some plugins of ecl1 are started when eclipse starts. 
		To disable auto start plugins, navigate to: <code>Window → Preferences → General → Startup and Shutdown</code> and uncheck the undesired plugins. 
	</p>
	
	<p> The following plugins are automatically started: </p> 
	
	<h3> Ecl1 Classpath Container </h3>
	<p>
	  This plugin initializes the ecl1 classpath container when eclipse is started. Without a properly initialized ecl1 classpath container,
	  eclipse <strong>cannot</strong> compile webapps. Further information about classpath containers can be found <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/jdt/core/r2.0/classpath%20container/classpathContainer.html">here.</a>
	</p>
	<p>
	  This plugin also enriches the classpath of JUnit tests and Java Applications. Without this enriching JUnit tests from HISinOne-Extensions <strong>will</strong> fail. 
	</p>

	<h3> Ecl1 Git Auto Lfs Prune </h3>	
	<p> 
		Runs <code>git lfs prune</code> in every git versioned project in the workspace. <code>Git lfs prune</code> deletes local copies of LFS files that are old, thus freeing up disk space. Further information about <code>git lfs prune</code> can be found <a href="https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/docs/man/git-lfs-prune.1.ronn">here.</a>
	</p>
	
	<h3> Ecl1 Update Git Hooks </h3>	
	<p> 
		Installs a git hook script in every HISinOne-Extension in the current workspace. These git hook scripts try to enforce the rule that every commit message must include a ticket number (format: #123456). Further information about git hooks can be found <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks">here.</a>
	</p>
	
	<h3> Ecl1 Update Check</h3>	
	<p> 
		Checks for ecl1 updates and proceeds to install them if found. Ecl1 updates can also be installed through the regular install mechanism of eclipse.  
	</p>
	
	
<h2 id="manual_plugins">Manually Started Plugins</h2>


	<h3 id="create" >Create a new Extension</h3>
	
		<p>Ecl1 adds an entry to the creation-assistant:</p>
		
		<p>To create a new extension select "HISinOne Extension Project" from the category "HISinOne" after selecting New from File menu or pressing Ctrl + N.</p>
		<img src="ecl1-new-wizzard.png">

		<p>After selecting the wizard for a new HISinOne Extension Project, you need to choose a name for the extension you want to develop.
		Ideally, you pick a name that follows the java package naming conventions, as you can see in the following screenshot.</p>
		<img src="ecl1-project-name.png">

		<p><img src="ecl1-project-structure.png"></p>

		<p>Finally, you now have a fully operational HISinOne-extension skeleton. It even has a <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> repository prepared for sharing with fellow developers.</p>

<!-- TODO
<h3>Create a new EnrollChecker</h3>
 -->
 	<h3>Import existing extensions</h3>

 	<p>The invisibility of other extensions is a challenge. We try to tackle this hurdle with a dedicated import wizard for HISinOne-Extensions</p>

 	<p>In the category HISinOne the wizard Extension Import offers a simple one-click way of importing a set of existing extensions into your workspace.
 	<img alt="Screenshot of import wizard showing a list of HISinOne extensions for import" src="ecl1-import-wizard.png"></p>

 	<p>To make the import suitable to your custom environment, build server as source for available extensions and git server as version control system are configurable.
 	<img alt="Screenshot of preferences dialogue showing configuration parameters for extension import." src="ecl1-import-preferences.png"></p>
 	
	<h3> Commit Exporter </h3>	
	<p> 
		Export wizard to create HIS specific hotfix XML snippets. Useful for creating hotfixes for HISinOne. 
	</p>
	
	<h3> Git Batch Pull </h3>	
	<p> 
		Adds a "Git Batch Pull Command" button to eclipse. When pressed, eclipse executes <code>git pull</code> for all git versioned projects in the workspace. 
	</p>
	
	<h3> HIS Runtime Classpath Provider</h3>	
	<p> 
		Enriches the classpath when starting JUnit-Test from HIS-extensions. Without it, the JUnit-Tests don't run when started from eclipse. 
	</p>
	
	<h3> HIS Extension Point Collector </h3>	
	<p> 
		Every HIS extension has a extension.ant.properties. When a HIS extension is built, ecl1 scans the extension for extended extension points and updates the extension.ant.properties accordingly. 
	</p>
